### Week 4: Design Resilient Architectures (Part 1)

#### Objectives:
- Understand the principles behind building scalable and loosely coupled architectures.
- Learn about disaster recovery strategies that ensure business continuity.
- Familiarize with AWS services that facilitate scalability and resilience.

#### Topics:
- **Scalable and Loosely Coupled Architectures**: Explore concepts like microservices, event-driven architectures, and serverless designs. Study the use of Amazon SQS, AWS Lambda, and AWS Fargate to achieve scalability and loose coupling.
- **Disaster Recovery (DR) Strategies**: Learn about the various DR strategies such as backup and restore, pilot light, warm standby, and multi-site solutions, focusing on RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective).
- **AWS Services for Resilience**: Deep dive into services like AWS Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon Route 53, and Amazon RDS, which play crucial roles in creating resilient and fault-tolerant systems.

#### Study Materials:
- **AWS Documentation**: Extensive reading on services like [Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/), [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), and [AWS Elastic Load Balancing](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/), with a focus on their resilience and scalability features.
- **Whitepapers and Blogs**: AWS whitepapers such as "[AWS Disaster Recovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/disaster-recovery-workloads-on-aws/introduction.html)" that discuss best practices in building resilient systems.

#### Activities:
- **Architecture Design Tasks**: Draft multiple architecture scenarios using tools like Lucidchart to visualize how various AWS services contribute to resilience and scalability.
- **Practical Scenarios**: Analyze different disaster recovery scenarios and discuss the suitable AWS services and configurations that would be appropriate for each scenario.
