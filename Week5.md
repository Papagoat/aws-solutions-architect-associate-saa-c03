### Week 5: Design Resilient Architectures (Part 2)

#### Objectives:
- Deepen knowledge on designing high availability and fault-tolerant systems using AWS.
- Explore AWS global infrastructure and how it supports resilience.
- Understand the application of advanced concepts such as failover strategies and immutable infrastructure.

#### Topics:
- **High Availability and Fault Tolerance**: Focus on designing systems that are operational and available at all times across different AWS regions and availability zones.
- **Failover Strategies**: Study different approaches to ensure a system remains operational in the event of component failures, including DNS failover with Amazon Route 53 and auto-scaling features.
- **AWS Services for High Availability**: Detailed exploration of services like AWS Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments, and AWS Auto Scaling Groups.

#### Study Materials:
- **AWS Documentation**: In-depth study of [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/), AWS Elastic Load Balancing, [Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), and [AWS Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/), focusing on their high availability and fault tolerance configurations.

#### Activities:
- **Simulation Exercises**: Conduct tabletop exercises to simulate system failures and recovery using different AWS services. This helps in understanding the practical application of theoretical knowledge.
- **Design Challenges**: Create detailed architectural diagrams for hypothetical applications that require high availability and fault tolerance, utilizing AWS recommended practices.
