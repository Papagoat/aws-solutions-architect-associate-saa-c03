### Week 8: Design Cost-Optimized Architectures

#### Objectives:
- Understand how to design architectures that minimize costs while maintaining performance and scalability.
- Learn about AWS cost management tools and features that help track and reduce expenses.
- Explore strategies for cost optimization across storage, compute, database, and network services on AWS.

#### Topics:
- **Cost Optimization Principles**: Introduction to the fundamental strategies for cost reduction in AWS environments, including right-sizing resources, increasing elasticity, and choosing the correct pricing models.
- **AWS Cost Management Tools**: In-depth study of tools like AWS Budgets, AWS Cost Explorer, and the AWS Cost and Usage Report to monitor and control AWS spending.
- **Cost-Effective Resource Selection**: Learn how to select the most cost-effective resources for specific use cases, focusing on storage (like Amazon S3, Amazon EBS), compute (like Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda), and databases (like Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB).

#### Study Materials:
- **AWS Documentation**: Comprehensive reading on [AWS cost management services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/what-is-costmanagement.html), [pricing models](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/), and documentation on how to optimize costs for various AWS services.
- **Whitepapers and Blogs**: Study AWS whitepapers such as "[Cost Optimization in AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/wellarchitected/2022-03-31/framework/cost-optimization.html)" that offer tips and detailed examples of cost-saving measures.

#### Activities:
- **Cost Analysis Projects**: Analyze different AWS architectures and identify potential areas for cost savings by applying learned principles and using AWS cost management tools.
- **Simulation Exercises**: Use simulators like AWS Pricing Calculator to model costs of different architectures and identify less expensive alternatives.
