### Week 3: Design Secure Architectures (Part 2)

#### Objectives:
- Develop skills in designing secure network architectures and workloads on AWS.
- Learn to implement security controls that protect applications and data.
- Gain knowledge on AWS services and features that enhance security.

#### Topics:
- **Designing Secure Access to AWS Resources**: Understanding how to control access to resources using services like AWS Security Token Service (STS), role switching, and cross-account access.
- **Securing Workloads and Applications**: Focusing on security groups, network ACLs, route tables, and the use of AWS Shield and AWS WAF for protecting applications.
- **AWS Services for Security**: Deep dive into services like Amazon Cognito for user identity management, AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS Single Sign-On), and AWS Secrets Manager for managing secrets.

#### Study Materials:
- **AWS Documentation**: Comprehensive reading on [AWS Security Token Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/welcome.html), [AWS WAF](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/), [AWS Shield](https://aws.amazon.com/shield/), and [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/).

#### Activities:
- **Security Designs**: Draw security architecture designs that incorporate AWS security services and best practices, focusing on different layers of security (e.g., perimeter, internal, data-level).
