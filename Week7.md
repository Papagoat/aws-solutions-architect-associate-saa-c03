### Week 7: Design High-Performing Architectures (Part 2)

#### Objectives:
- Enhance understanding of high-performing database and network solutions on AWS.
- Learn to design and optimize database architectures for performance and scalability.
- Explore AWS networking technologies that can improve application performance.

#### Topics:
- **High-Performing Database Solutions**: Focus on services like Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB, and their features such as read replicas, database caching, and query optimization.
- **Database Scaling and Performance**: Understand different database engines and their scaling capabilities, including the choice between SQL and NoSQL based on use cases.
- **Network Performance Optimization**: Study AWS networking services such as Amazon VPC, AWS Direct Connect, and Amazon CloudFront to enhance connectivity and reduce latency.

#### Study Materials:
- **AWS Documentation**: Extensive reading on [Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [Amazon VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html), and [AWS Direct Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/). Explore the setup and configuration for performance.

#### Activities:
- **Database Design Exercise**: Sketch out database schemas for high-throughput applications, considering factors like data distribution, indexing, and query performance.
- **Networking Diagrams**: Create diagrams for complex network architectures using AWS services, focusing on reducing latency and increasing throughput.
