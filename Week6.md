### Week 6: Design High-Performing Architectures (Part 1)

#### Objectives:
- Learn to identify and implement high-performing storage and compute solutions on AWS.
- Explore how to optimize performance and scalability for AWS applications.
- Understand the selection of appropriate AWS services and configurations for enhanced performance.

#### Topics:
- **High-Performing Storage Solutions**: Dive into Amazon S3 for object storage, Amazon EBS for block storage, and Amazon EFS for file storage. Understand options for data storage that meet performance demands.
- **High-Performing Compute Solutions**: Study AWS compute services like Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, and AWS Fargate. Focus on selecting the right compute resources based on application requirements.
- **Performance Optimization**: Learn about performance tuning and best practices for AWS storage and compute services.

#### Study Materials:
- **AWS Documentation**: Detailed exploration of documentation on [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [Amazon EBS](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/), [Amazon EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/), [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), and [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/).
- **Technical Whitepapers and Blogs**: Read AWS whitepapers like "[Amazon S3 Performance Optimization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/optimizing-performance.html)"  that discuss real-world performance tuning scenarios.

#### Activities:
- **Performance Analysis Tasks**: Conduct theoretical analysis and plan optimizations for hypothetical application scenarios that involve heavy data loads and compute requirements.
- **Interactive Labs**: Although hands-on labs are not available, virtual labs or guided scenarios from platforms like Qwiklabs or A Cloud Guru can offer simulated experiences.
