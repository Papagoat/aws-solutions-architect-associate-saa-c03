## Question 1

One of the biggest football leagues in Europe has granted the distribution rights for live streaming its matches in the USA to a silicon valley based streaming services company.

## Question 3
A US-based healthcare startup is building an interactive diagnostic tool for COVID-19 related assessments. The users would be required to capture their personal health records via this tool. As this is sensitive health information, the backup of the user data must be kept encrypted in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The startup does not want to provide its own encryption keys but still wants to maintain an audit trail of when an encryption key was used and by whom.

Which of the following is the BEST solution for this use-case?

1. Use client-side encryption with client provided keys and then upload the encrypted user data to Amazon S3

2. Use server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service keys (SSE-KMS) to encrypt the user data on Amazon S3

3. Use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) to encrypt the user data on Amazon S3

4. Use server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C) to encrypt the user data on Amazon S3

The company follows the principle of least privilege.

```json
        "Version": "2021-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Action": [
                    "s3:ListBucket",
                    "s3:DeleteObject"
                ],
                "Resource": [
                    "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket"
                ],
                "Effect": "Allow"
            }
        ]
```  

Which statement should a solutions architect add to the policy to address this issue?

1. 
```json
    {
        "Action": [
            "s3:DeleteObject"
        ],
        "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket*"

        ],
        "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
        ],
        "Effect": "Allow"
    }
```

```json
    {
        "Action": [
            "s3:*Object"
        ],
        "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
        ],
        "Effect": "Allow"
    }

## Question 13
A social photo-sharing company uses Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to store the images uploaded by the users. These images are kept encrypted in Amazon S3 by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) and the company manages its own AWS KMS keys for encryption. A member of the DevOps team accidentally deleted the AWS KMS key a day ago, thereby rendering the user's photo data unrecoverable. You have been contacted by the company to consult them on possible solutions to this crisis.

As a solutions architect, which of the following steps would you recommend to solve this issue?

1. The AWS KMS key can be recovered by the AWS root account user

2. The company should issue a notification on its web application informing the users about the loss of their data

3. As the AWS KMS key was deleted a day ago, it must be in the 'pending deletion' status and hence you can just cancel the KMS key deletion and recover the key

4. Contact AWS support to retrieve the AWS KMS key from their backup

---

## Question 14
An organization wants to delegate access to a set of users from the development environment so that they can access some resources in the production environment which is managed under another AWS account.

As a solutions architect, which of the following steps would you recommend?

1. It is not possible to access cross-account resources

2. Create a new IAM role with the required permissions to access the resources in the production environment. The users can then assume this IAM role while accessing the resources from the production environment

3. Both IAM roles and IAM users can be used interchangeably for cross-account access

4. Create new IAM user credentials for the production environment and share these credentials with the set of users from the development environment

---

## Question 15
An IT company wants to review its security best-practices after an incident was reported where a new developer on the team was assigned full access to Amazon DynamoDB. The developer accidentally deleted a couple of tables from the production environment while building out a new feature.

Which is the MOST effective way to address this issue so that such incidents do not recur?

1. Only root user should have full database access in the organization

2. The CTO should review the permissions for each new developer's IAM user so that such incidents don't recur

3. Use permissions boundary to control the maximum permissions employees can grant to the IAM principals

4. Remove full database access for all IAM users in the organization
